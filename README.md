# Multithreaded-Parking-System-Simulation
A multithreaded parking system simulation using semaphores to manage 4 parking spots across 3 gates. Cars arrive at different times, park for a set duration, and leave. The system ensures safe parking with concurrency control, logging activities and parking status throughout the simulation.
